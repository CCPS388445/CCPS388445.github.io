  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>For my future professional life, I want to successfully achieve graduating from an Ivy league college with a degree that helps me work in the forensics field since I really like it. I think the main reason my passion has led me here if due to me really liking unsolved crimes and anything that had to do with all the unknown and the known. I am working towards these goals by taking honors classes to rank up my credits and I am taking time and effort to study and keep my passion for forensics. Next year I will be taking law and studies which goes hand in hand with forensics and law and then in junior year, I will be taking forensics science. The values I consider the most necessary for my success are that I keep my strive and perseverance as well as bettering my procrastination while keeping my life intact. Due to that I want to pass these last two quarters with at least all A's or with a couple of B's (2) but nothing less than that.  I want to be known as someone who is responsible and capable of the greater good but also be known for the striving power I have. I want to be seen as someone with great potential and not one who fails under pressure when things get hard. The achievements I want to have been very specific to my goals, in which senior year I want to get the bright futures scholarship and find my own pathway through life while also making my family proud.</p>
